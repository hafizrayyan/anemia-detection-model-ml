Anemia Detection App

This repository contains an Anemia Detection application built using machine learning classification models.
The application predicts whether a person is likely to have anemia based on relevant health parameters.

The project focuses on data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using supervised learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview

Live App : https://anemia-detection-model-by-hafiz-rayyan-asif.streamlit.app/
Anemia is a common health condition that can be identified using key blood-related indicators.
This project applies machine learning to assist in early detection by analyzing patterns in historical data.

The goal is classification:

Anemic

Non-anemic

Models Used

Logistic Regression was used due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for binary classification tasks.
